# Responsive Task Management App using Vite, React with Ts and Bootstrap

## Overview

Welcome to the Responsive Task Management App README! This application allows users to create tasks and classify them as active or complete. It's built using a combination of React with TypeScript for the web, Bootstrap for layout and design, and Vite as the build tool. This app provides a simple  effective interface for managing tasks.
